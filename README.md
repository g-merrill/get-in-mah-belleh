# truckSFinder

For my first full-stack web application for SEI Project 2, I wanted to create something that I could  use on a regular basis.  Enter truckSFinder!  This app is intended to document the different food trucks that a user has visited, log their reviews and ratings, and possibly save food trucks for future visits!  Much more functionality and more streamlined designs are in the works.

## Getting Started

When you browse to [truckSFinder](https://trucksfinder.herokuapp.com), you will immediately be show a list of all food trucks currently in the database:

Use the nav bar at the top of the screen for easy navigation around the app.

You must be logged in through your Google account to: 

  * add a food truck to the database,
  * favorite a food truck,
  * add a review to a food truck,
  * edit your submitted food truck,
  * delete your submitted food truck,
  * edit your review,
  * or delete your review.

To log in, click the 'Log in' button at the top right corner and proceed as directed.

Creating an account apart from your Google account is not functional at this time.
