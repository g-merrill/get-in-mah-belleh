# truckSFinder

For my first full-stack web application for SEI Project 2, I wanted to create something that I could use on a regular basis.  Enter truckSFinder.  This app is intended to document the different food trucks that a user has visited, log their reviews and ratings, and even save food trucks for future visits!  More functionality and a more streamlined design for this app are in the works!

## Getting Started

When you browse to [truckSFinder](https://trucksfinder.herokuapp.com), you will immediately be shown a list of all the food trucks currently in the database:

The truckSFinder home page.

Use the nav bar at the top of the screen for easy navigation around the app.

To log in, click the 'Log in' button at the top right corner of the screen and proceed as directed.
